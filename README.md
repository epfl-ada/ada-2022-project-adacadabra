## Abstract
Literature is a mirror of history. At least some forms of literature can be interpreted as a memory of the past. Authors write about challenges, problems and fates of individuals and society, which reflects their perspective of the times theyâ€™re living in, even though sometimes no evident connection to a specific historical moment needs to exist. Can such a statement be adapted to other media formats, like movies, as well? Surely there exist a lot of movies, which purely serve the purpose to entertain. But, as in literature, there could be some degree of reflection of contemporary events and developments hidden in the plots or characteristics of a movie, a reflection of history.

In this project, we try to investigate that subject by analysing the data in the dataset CMU Movie Summary Corpus. We determine through different tests whether specific events and developments in history have had an influence on various parameters of the movie industry, like the plots of movies or the types of movies that were produced.
